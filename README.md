# Cryptsp: Next Generation Unified Cryptography Library

## Secure, Powerful, and Ready for the Future
Welcome to Cryptsp, a modern cryptography library designed to simplify and enhance your encryption, decryption, and security workflows. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, Cryptsp is your go-to toolkit for building robust, secure applications.

## Introduction

**Cryptsp** is a powerful and easy-to-use cryptography library that combines multiple cryptographic techniques under a single package. It supports:
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES, ChaCha20, Salsa20
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA, ECC
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2, Argon2
- **Hashing & Digital Signatures**: SHA-256, HMAC, RSA Signatures

This library simplifies cryptographic operations by integrating multiple libraries into a unified interface, allowing users to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify data with minimal effort.

## Benefits of Using Cryptsp

- **Unparalleled Security**: Built on industry-leading cryptography libraries like PyCryptodome and JWT, Cryptsp ensures your data is encrypted with state-of-the-art algorithms.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed to perform without draining resources, Cryptsp is highly efficient even on systems with limited capacity.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple function calls to encrypt, decrypt, and sign data.
- **Versatility**: Supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption along with key derivation and hashing.
- **Security**: Encrypt and decrypt files with support for multiple algorithms, making it a perfect fit for securing sensitive data in transit or storage.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-use functions save time and reduce the complexity of writing cryptographic code.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install **Cryptsp**, use the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptsp
```

## Example Usage
### 1. Encrypt and Decrypt with AES

```python
manager = CryptoManager()
key = manager.generate_key()
encrypted_data = manager.encrypt_aes("Hello, AES-GCM!", key, mode='GCM')
decrypted_data = manager.decrypt_aes(encrypted_data, key)
print("Decrypted (AES-GCM):", decrypted_data.decode())

print("Ciphertext:", encrypted_data)
print("Decrypted Text:", decrypted_data)
```

### 2. RSA Encryption and Decryption

```python
from cryptsp import CryptoManager

private_key, public_key = manager.generate_rsa_keypair()
encrypted_data = manager.encrypt_rsa("Hello, RSA!", public_key)
decrypted_data = manager.decrypt_rsa(encrypted_data, private_key)
print("Decrypted (RSA):", decrypted_data.decode())
```
